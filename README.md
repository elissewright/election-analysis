# Colorado Python Data Analysis

## Overview:

### This audit was performed on behalf of the Colorado Board of Elections, in order to evaluate the congressional precinct votes for a recent election. Python was used to assess total votes per candidate, percentage of votes for each candidate, and winner based on popular vote. We also evaluated voter turnout based on county, and determined the county with the largest turnout. 

## Election-Audit Results: 

#### * Between three Colorado counties, there was a total of 369,711 votes case in this congressional election

#### * Our total votes include three counties in the precinct: Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe. Among these counties, the voter turnout breakdown was as follows: Denver with 306,055 votes (or 82.8% of the total), Jefferson with 38,855 votes (10.5% of total), and Arapahoe with 24,801 votes (6.7% of the total)

#### * Out of the three counties surveyed, Denver County had the largest turnout, coming in at 82.8% of the total vote count

#### * Among the total votes received at 369,711, the breakdown by candidate is as follows: Diana DeGett with 272,892 votes (or 73.8% of the total), Charles Casper Stockholm with 85,213 votes (23.0% of total) and Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 votes (3.1% of total). 

#### * Diana DeGett was the winning candidate by a wide margin, with 73.8% of the total votes

## Election-Audit Summary: 

### This code may be modified for use with other elections, including larger ones involving higher numbers of voters or wider locations, such as multiple counties or states. For example, we could modify the script to analyze presidential election data by evaluating percentage and number of votes for presidential candidates at the state level. Or we could modify the script to work for analyzing smaller elections, such as percentage and number of votes for a single county-level position by zip code locations. 

### Depending on access to additional data, we could also modify the code to analyze votes by demographics, or the demographic breakdown of specific voting locations. This would allow us to evaluate factors such as how many people voted for each candidate within each county, or stratify each county's votes by factors such as sex, income and education level, or age group. 

### By including other tools like Pandas and Matplotlib to our Python libraries, we could do even more powerful analyses and visualizations of election data. Python is a valuable tool for data analysis, with vast potential.
